# write a program which asks the user for two words. 
# The program should then print out whichever of the two comes alphabetically last.

#You can assume all words will be typed in lowercase entirely.

# Some examples of expected behaviour:

1.
#Please type in the 1st word: car
#Please type in the 2nd word: scooter
#scooter comes alphabetically last.

2.
#Please type in the 1st word: zorro
#Please type in the 2nd word: batman
#zorro comes alphabetically last.

3.
#Please type in the 1st word: python
#Please type in the 2nd word: python
#You gave the same word twice.
