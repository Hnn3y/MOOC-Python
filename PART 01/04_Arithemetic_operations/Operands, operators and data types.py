# The data type of an operand usually determines the data type of the result: 
# if two integers are added together, the result will also be an integer. 
# If a floating point number is subtracted from another floating point number, the result is a floating point number. 
# In fact, if a single one of the operands in an expression is a floating point number, the result will also be a floating point number, regardless of the other operands.

# Division / is an exception to this rule. 
# Its result is a floating point number, even if the operands are integers. 
# For example 1 / 5 will result in the floating point number 0.2.
