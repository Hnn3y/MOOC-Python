# Another central technique in programming is repetition, or iteration.
# They are called control structures because essentially they allow you to control which lines of code get executed when.
# While conditional structures allow you to choose between sections of code, iteration structures allow you to repeat sections of code. 
# They are often called loops because they allow the program to "loop back" to some line that was already executed before. 
# The process of executing one repetition of a loop is also referred to as an iteration of the loop.
