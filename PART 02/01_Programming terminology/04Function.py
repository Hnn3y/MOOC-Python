# A function executes some functionality. 
# Functions can also take one or more arguments, which are data that can be fed to and processed by the function. 
# Arguments are sometimes also referred to as parameters. 
# There is a technical distinction between an argument and a parameter, but the words are often used interchangeably.

# A function is executed when it is called. 
# The value a function returns is often stored in a variable so that it can be used in the program later on.
