# If the syntax of the program is correct but the program still doesn't function as intended, there is a bug in the program.

# Errors during execution are usually rather easy to fix, because the error message states the line of code causing the error. 
# Of course the actual reason for the bug might be somewhere quite different than the line of code causing the error.

#Sometimes a bug in the program is revealed because the result the code produces is wrong. 
# Discovering and locating this type of bug can be challenging. 
# In the programming exercises on this course the tests are usually intended to reveal bugs of this type. 
# Before a bug can be fixed, its cause must first be located.

#Programming jargon refers to discovering the causes of bugs as debugging. 
# It is an extremely important skill in any programmer's toolbox. 
# Professional programmers often spend more time debugging than writing fresh code.

#A simple yet effective way of debugging a program is adding debugging print statements to your code. 
# Verifying the results of your code with print commands gives a quick confirmation the code does what you want it to do.

#Debugging usually means running the program multiple times. 
# It can come in handy to temporarily "hard-code" the problematic input, instead of asking the user for input each time.

#When the program has been fixed, remember to remove all debugging print statements and other code added for debugging purposes.

#This example was quite simple, and in such a short program one could probably figure out the bugs just by reading the code carefully. 
# However, using debugging print statements is often a quick way to get a feeling for where the problem might lie. 
# Print statements can be used to figure out which parts of the program seem to work correctly, so bug tracking efforts can be concentrated on the sections of code which are the most likely culprits.

#Debugging print statements are only one tool for debugging programs. 
# We will come back to this subject later on during this course. 
# You should now get into the habit of using debugging print statements to look for mistakes in your code. 
# Programming professionals cannot get by without using them, so it is a very useful tool for beginners as well.
