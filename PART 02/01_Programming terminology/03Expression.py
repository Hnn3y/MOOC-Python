# An expression is a bit of code that results in a determined data type. 
# When the program is executed, the expression is evaluated so that it has a value that can then be used in the program.

# Here are a few examples of expressions:

#Expression	   Value	   Type	                  Python data type
#2 + 4 + 3	    9	      integer	               int
#"abc" + "de"	"abcde"	string	               str
#11 / 2	       5.5	   floating point number	float
#2 * 5 > 9	    True	   Boolean value	         bool
