# A block is a group of consecutive statements that are at the same level in the structure of the program.

if age > 17:
    # beginning of the conditional block
    print("You are of age!")
    age = age + 1
    print("You are now one year older...")
    # end of the conditional block

print("This here belongs to another block")

# In Python blocks are expressed by indenting all code in the block by the same amount of whitespace.
